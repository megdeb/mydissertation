 A grad student, an infosec technologist, a beach addict, and an amateur chef. I’m passionate about privacy and security, while also creating technology that has a positive impact on the world. I enjoy making products usable and useful for communities who need them most. 
 
 I am currently conducting research for my dissertation at the University of Oxford. My research will center around understanding the risks tied to the technologies used during the 2020 U.S. Primaries.

My research aims are three-fold:
* Understand the different risks based on the technologies utilized in the 2020 primaries
* More deeply analyze tooling used in certain states as case studies (from voting machines to tabulation technologies to tools utilized by volunteers and practitioners)
* Create a concise output of actions, improvements, and recommendations for the future
