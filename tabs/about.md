I am currently conducting research for my dissertation at the University of Oxford. My research will center around understanding the risks tied to the technologies used during the 2020 U.S. Primaries.

My research aims are three-fold:
* Understand the different risks based on the technologies utilized in the 2020 primaries
* More deeply analyze several states tool usage as case studies (from voting machines to tabulation technologies to tools utilized by volunteers and practitioners)
* Create a concise output of actions, improvements, and recommendations for the future
